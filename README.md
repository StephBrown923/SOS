# SOS
SOS - Save Our Soles - is a peer review based social network that will help collectors find trusted restorers and provide an opportunity for restorers to find more work.

Business

Users 

Users who need work done on a sneaker can create a listing with all of the necessary information. This listing will be made visible to all restorers. The restorers can read through the listing and decide whether or not they want to give a quote to complete the work.

The lowest priced quote is not the only thing to consider. Restorers will have a review based rating system based on other User's past experiences. This will include things like communication, quality, turn-around time, etc.

SOS will be a free app, with opportunites to monetize, such as "suggested" restorers, and possibly providing some kind of protection for both user and restorer for a percentage of the quoted price.
